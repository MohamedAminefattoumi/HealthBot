# HealthBot
An AI-powered web application that predicts the risk of diabetes based on user-provided health information. This project uses a machine learning model served via a simple API interface.
The user sends health-related parameters (age, weight, medical history, etc.) to a RESTful API. The system processes the input with a trained AI model and returns whether the person is at low, moderate, or high risk of diabetes.
